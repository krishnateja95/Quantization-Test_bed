# Quantization-Test_bed <br /> 
Quantization of Neural Networks <br /> 

This is a test environment developed for experimenting Quantization of Neural Networks (CNN,MLP). <br /> 



Special thanks <br /> 
  i) [fchollet](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases) for providing pretrained models <br />
  ii) [aaron-xichen](https://github.com/aaron-xichen) for providing the preprocessed imagenet validation samples with labels <br />   


Create a folder Data and store the preprocessed imagenet validation images <br />
Create a folder Weights to save all the pretrained models <br />
